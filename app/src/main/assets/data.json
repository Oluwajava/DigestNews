He was also fiercely protective of his independence, battling his record company over control of his material — and even his name. The dazzlingly talented and charismatic singer, songwriter, arranger and instrumentalist drew upon musicians ranging from James Brown to Jimi Hendrix to the Beatles, creating a widely imitated blend of rock, funk and soul.",

          "text": "Prince was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and developed an interest in music at an early age, writing his first song at age seven. After recording songs with his cousin's band 94 East, 19-year-old Prince recorded several unsuccessful demo tapes before releasing his debut album For You in 1978, under the guidance of manager Owen Husney. His 1979 album Prince went platinum due to the success of the singles \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\". His next three records—Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982)—continued his success, showcasing Prince's trademark of prominently sexual lyrics and incorporation of elements of funk, dance, and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as The Revolution and released Purple Rain, which served as the soundtrack to his film debut of the same name. A prolific songwriter, Prince in the 1980s wrote songs for and produced work by many other acts, often under pseudonyms. After releasing the albums Around the World in a Day (1985) and Parade (1986), The Revolution disbanded and Prince released the critically acclaimed double album Sign \"O\" the Times (1987) as a solo artist. He released three more solo albums before debuting The New Power Generation band in 1991. He changed his stage name in 1993 to an unpronounceable symbol, also known as the \"Love Symbol\". He then began releasing new albums at a faster pace to remove himself from contractual obligations to Warner Bros.; he released five records between 1994 and 1996 before signing with Arista Records in 1998. In 2000, he began referring to himself as \"Prince\" again. He released 15 albums since then, including his latest, HITnRUN Phase One, which was first released exclusively on the Tidal streaming service on September 7, 2015 before being released on CD on September 15, 2015 by NPG Records.",

        "caption": "NASA has been working on a UAS traffic management (UTM) system to handle the growing number of unmanned aerial vehicles taking to the skies. On Tuesday the system successfully underwent its largest test to date, a NASA spokesman told Digital Trends, with remote flights at all six FAA test sites this week.\nAs part of the testing, drone operators at each site simultaneously flew a variety of remote-controlled unmanned aircraft systems. The test sites are dispersed across the country and included locations in Alaska, North Dakota, Nevada, New York, Virginia, and Maryland. At one point, a whopping 24 drones took to the air at the same time during this early stage of testing.\nSuccess! 24 #drones in the air for a great test of the UTM research platform! https://t.co/bpxHbOuKmi #nasaaero pic.twitter.com/RjrALUpY3U\n— Ames Research Center (@NASAAmes) April 19, 2016\n\nTo hit that number, each test site flew up to four drones at a time while interacting with the UTM system during all stages of the flight. Before flying, each drone operator entered a flight plan into the UTM system, which checked the proposed path for potential conflicts and either approved or rejected the flight. Operators were notified of their approval status before their scheduled flight time. Once in the air, the drone’s flight pattern was tracked by the UTM both on a local and a national level — leading to the amazing image atop this article. Not only were the flights tracked at each FAA test site,  each drone also was monitored remotely by engineers working at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California.\nRelated: A drone may have collided with a major airliner for the first time\nThese tests were a milestone for the system — it’s the first time the UTM research platform was tested at all six FAA sites at the same time. It was the largest live test with 24 simultaneous live flights and the first time both live and simulated flights have been processed by the platform. It was also the first time controllers at each location tested the NASA-developed UTM displays and apps on a live flight. NASA hopes to use information gathered from these tests to refine the system so it can track different types of unmanned aircraft and a greater number of them flying in geographically diverse locations.\nUpdated on 04-21-2016 by Jeremy Kaplan: Corrected the headline to show that the FAA is not involved in testing, but has agreed to allow NASA to use its test sites, and to reflect successful completion of the test.\n\n\nAlso watch: Raimond de Hullu’s vision for Oas1s green buildings\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPlease enable Javascript to watch this video",
